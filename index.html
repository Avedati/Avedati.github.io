					<div class='portfolio-cell' id='AI2048'>
						<h1>AI 2048</h1>
						<p>This project is a Pure Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm playing 2048, written in C++ using the SFML library. I wrote this project to test my programming skills by implementing the algorithm suggested by Ronenz in this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048</p>

					<div class='portfolio-cell' id='Armadillo'>
						<h1>Armadillo</h1>
						<p>This is the armadillo text editor. It was made for use on a chromebook. It has minimal features, including execution of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and saving multiple files together as a JSON object. I wrote this program to learn more about text editors and to test my skills as a programmer.</p>

					<div class='portfolio-cell' id='SummaryBuilder'>
						<h1>Summary Builder</h1>
						<p>Summary Builder is a website which summarizes input text. My goal for this project was to create a variant of the algorithm described in this article: https://blog.floydhub.com/gentle-introduction-to-text-summarization-in-machine-learning/</p>
					</div>
					<div class='portfolio-cell' id='HTMLGamesAndTools'>
						<h1>HTML Games and Tools</h1>
						<p>These are a collection of games and tools in the form of webpages which I wrote shortly after my python games. I build these websites to practice building games using HTML5 Canvas and building websites using HTML and CSS.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='portfolio-cell' id='PythonGames'>
						<h1>Python Games</h1>
						<p>These are a collection of short and simple games that I wrote using Python and Pygame (a graphics library for Python). I wrote these games to practice writing games with Pygame and to learn more about game design.</p>
