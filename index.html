				<h1>AI-based Alzheimer's Disease predictor</h1>
				<p>In order to analyze the causes of the Alzheimer's Disease and thus learn more about it, I have conducted a statistical analysis project on open source data. The PDF included in this project describes my general process of analyzing the dataset, preparing the data, and building a neural network to predict Alzheimer’s Disease, under the guidance of my school’s statistics teacher.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='MyLisp'>
				<h1>MyLisp</h1>
				<p>My lisp is a simple lisp interpreter written in C11. My goal for this project was to learn about symbolic programming and test my skills by building an interpreter for a "non-traditional" programming language.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='AI2048'>
				<h1>AI 2048</h1>
				<p>This project is a Pure Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm playing 2048, written in C++ using the SFML library. I wrote this project to test my programming skills by implementing the algorithm suggested by Ronenz in this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048</p>

			<div class='project' id='gamedesigncourse'>
				<h1>Game Design Course</h1>
				<p>This course teaching principles of game design by walking the student through the design of a simple pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='Athenaeum'>
				<h1>Athenaeum</h1>
				<p>This is a web scraper written in C using cURL. It is aimed to improve upon Upsilon and also to help me learn more about web scraping. </p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='AbhiScript'>
				<h1>AbhiScript</h1>
				<p>AbhiScript is a lisp-like, interpreted, programming language. My goal for this project was to learn more about symbol tables and experiment with programming language design. </p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='Upsilon'>
				<h1>Upsilon</h1>
				<p>Upsilon is a web scraper written in python, using urllib.request to access webpages and tkinter for a GUI. My goal for this project was to apply my prior knowledge of compilers to tokenize HTML and extract data from it and learn about web scraping and Tkinter.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='Armadillo'>
				<h1>Armadillo</h1>
				<p>This is the armadillo text editor. It was made for use on a chromebook. It has minimal features, including execution of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and saving multiple files together as a JSON object. I wrote this program to learn more about text editors and to test my skills as a programmer.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='SummaryBuilder'>
				<h1>Summary Builder</h1>
				<p>Summary Builder is a website which summarizes input text. My goal for this project was to create a variant of the algorithm described in this article: https://blog.floydhub.com/gentle-introduction-to-text-summarization-in-machine-learning/</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='HTMLGamesAndTools'>
				<h1>HTML Games and Tools</h1>
				<p>These are a collection of games and tools in the form of webpages which I wrote shortly after my python games. I build these websites to practice building games using HTML5 Canvas and building websites using HTML and CSS.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='project' id='PythonGames'>
				<h1>Python Games</h1>
				<p>These are a collection of short and simple games that I wrote using Python and Pygame (a graphics library for Python). I wrote these games to practice writing games with Pygame and to learn more about game design.</p>
